Kinematic Analysis of ARISTO Robot using RoboAnalyzer

This repository corresponds to my article **[Kinematic Analysis of ARISTO Robot using RoboAnalyzer](https://medium.com/@manojreddy2404/kinematic-analysis-of-aristo-robot-using-roboanalyzer-a7d5f33a9742)**.  
It contains resources and simulation data to explore the ARISTO robot’s kinematics using the RoboAnalyzer software tool. I wrote this blog on Medium. Check it out..

**Project Overview**

--> This project focuses on the forward and inverse kinematic analysis of the ARISTO 6-axis articulated robot using RoboAnalyzer, a 3D model-based robotics simulation software developed by IIT Delhi.

--> The objective of this project is to understand the motion behavior, workspace, and joint-to-end-effector relationship of an industrial robotic manipulator through simulation-based analysis.

--> This work is relevant for applications in robotics, mechatronics, cyber-physical systems (CPS), and digital twin foundations.



**About ARISTO Robot** 

--> Type: 6-axis articulated robot

--> Payload: 2.5 kg

--> Reach: 800 mm

--> Degrees of Freedom: 6

--> Actuation: Servo motors

**Applications:**

1. Pick and place

2. Palletizing

3. Welding

4. Assembly

5. Material handling 

**Software Used** 

- RoboAnalyzer V5

- Free and open-source robotics learning software

- Supports kinematic and workspace analysis


**Kinematic Analysis Performed**

- Forward Kinematics

- Implemented using Denavit–Hartenberg (DH) parameters

- Calculates the position and orientation of the end-effector

- Helps understand how joint angles affect robot motion

**Inverse Kinematics**

- Solved using numerical methods

- Determines joint angles for a desired end-effector position

- Useful for trajectory planning and control

**Workspace Analysis**

- Visualizes reachable space of the robot

- Identifies motion limitations and safe operating zones

**Results and Observations**

- Joint-to-end-effector relationships were visualized clearly
- Workspace boundaries were successfully identified

- RoboAnalyzer proved effective for educational and pre-design analysis

- The project provides a foundation for Digital Twin and CPS-based extensions

All result plots and graphs are available in the results/ folder.
